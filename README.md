#### _A web application that returns numbers and outputs from 0 to the user input, August 23, 2019_

#### By _**Jennifer Batara**_

## Description

This web app asks for a users name, then a number to input. The web app will then return a list of numbers from 0 to the number the user input. Some numbers are special and the expected outputs are as follows:

1. Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, userName. I'm afraid I can't do that."
2. Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
3. Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"

The special outputs are listed from highest(top) to lowest(bottom) priority. Please read the specs section for more details on expected outputs and conditions.

## Specs

1. The user input number must be greater than 0
2. If multiple special numbers are present, the special output with the highest priority will be printed.
